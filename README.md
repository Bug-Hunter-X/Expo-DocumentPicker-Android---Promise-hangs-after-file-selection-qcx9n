## Expo DocumentPicker Android Hang Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's DocumentPicker API on Android.  After selecting a file using the DocumentPicker, the promise returned by `DocumentPicker.getDocumentAsync()` sometimes fails to resolve, leading to an application hang.  The issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently, but appears to be linked to specific Android versions or device configurations.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. `bugSolution.js` provides a possible workaround, though it may not completely resolve the issue in all cases.

**Possible Causes:**

* Android OS version compatibility issues.
* Underlying native module issues within the Expo DocumentPicker implementation.
* Asynchronous operation conflicts within the app.

**Workaround:**

The workaround in `bugSolution.js` involves adding a timeout and error handling to manage the unfulfilled promise.  This is not a complete fix, but it offers a strategy to improve the user experience by gracefully handling the failure.

Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and find a more permanent solution.  Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
